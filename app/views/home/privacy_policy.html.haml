        In
        order to operate the Dhokebaaz Platform and to provide You with information
        about products or services that may be of interest to You, We may collect
        "personal information" (i.e. information that could be used to
        contact You directly (without using the Dhokebaaz Platform) such as full name,
        postal address, phone number, credit/debit card information, or email address)
        or "demographic information" (i.e. information that You submit, or
        that We collect, that is not personal information; this may include, but is not
        limited to, zip code, hometown, gender, username, age/birth date, browsing
        history information, searching history information, and registration history
        information. Demographic information is divided into two categories: 1)
        "non-public information", which consists of information regarding a
        food trade and one-on-one communications between You and other users of the Dhokebaaz
        Platform; and 2) "public information", which consists of all other
        demographic information. Please note that nowhere on the Dhokebaaz Platform do
        We knowingly collect, keep or maintain personal information from children under
        the age of 16, as We require that all users represent to Us that they are at
        least 16 years old.

        We
        use Your email address and Your other personal information to help Us
        efficiently operate the Dhokebaaz Platform, to contact You in connection with
        Your transactions and other activities on the Dhokebaaz Platform (including,
        but not limited to, confirmation emails, or important news that could affect
        Your relationship with Dhokebaaz), to forward information regarding a food
        trade to You from other Users, to forward information regarding a food trade from
        You to other Users, and to contact You and others to suggest potential matches.
        These types of communications are known as "Operational

        contain commercial messages, such as banner ads and special offers.

        To
        operate the Dhokebaaz Platform, including processing Your transactions and
        supporting Your activities on the Dhokebaaz Platform, We may share Your
        personal information with Our agents, representatives, contractors and service
        providers so they can provide Us with support services such as email
        origination, receipt or support services, customer relationship management
        services, and order fulfillment. We require these entities not to use Your
        information for any other purpose.

        By
        purchasing, or registering or making reservations for, products or services
        offered or sponsored by third parties on the Dhokebaaz Platform, or electing to
        receive communications (such as emails or material by mail) or electing to
        participate in contests, sweepstakes or other programs (such as discount or
        rewards programs), offered or sponsored by third parties on the Dhokebaaz Platform,
        You consent to Our providing Your personal information to those third parties.
        Those third parties may use Your personal information in accordance with their
        own privacy policies. You will need to contact those third parties to instruct
        them directly regarding Your preferences for the use of Your personal
        information by them. Additionally, You agree that We may use and disclose all such
        information so submitted to such third parties in the same manner in which We
        are entitled to use and disclose any other information You submit to Us.

        Any
        third party with whom We are allowed to share Your personal information is
        authorized to use Your personal information in accordance with Our contractual
        arrangements with such third parties and in accordance with their own privacy
        policies, over which We have no control, and You agree that We are not
        responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions. Those who contact
        You will need to be instructed directly by You regarding Your preferences for
        the use of Your personal information by them.

        How
        We Use Demographic Data
    %p.MsoNormal{:style => "margin-bottom:16.0pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:\n        inter-ideograph;text-autospace:none"}
      %span{:style => "font-family:\"Helvetica\",\"sans-serif\""}
        We
        may review all demographic Data. We may use public information to enable other
        users to search Your profile, to determine whether Your location fit other
        user's requirements, and to communicate with You. We may use demographic
        information to tailor the Dhokebaaz Platform and communications to Your
        interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on an
        anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers Your
        identity). One of the reasons We may do this is to increase the likelihood that
        Our advertisers' goods and services will appeal to You as a user of the
        Dhokebaaz Platform. Our sharing of demographic information with advertisers is
        anonymous (i.e., We do not tell advertisers which particular Dhokebaaz Users
        are members of which demographic groups), subject to the rest of this privacy
        policy. When You respond to an advertisement, however, We ask You to remember
        that if that ad that is targeted to a demographic group and You decide to give
        the advertiser Your personal information, then the advertiser may be able to
        identify You as being a member of that demographic group.

        How
        to Edit Your Information

        Dhokebaaz
        provides You with the ability to access and edit Your personal information. To
        update Your personal info, click ?dit Profile?in the Dhokebaaz menu. There
        You can view, update and correct Your account information.
    %p.MsoNormal{:style => "margin-bottom:16.0pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:\n        inter-ideograph;text-autospace:none"}
      %span{:style => "font-family:\"Helvetica\",\"sans-serif\""}
        So
        that We can protect the integrity of sensitive data, there are certain pieces
        of information, that You cannot alter Yourself.
    %p.MsoNormal{:style => "margin-bottom:16.0pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:\n        inter-ideograph;text-autospace:none"}

        Our
        databases automatically update any personal information You edit in Your
        profile, or that You request We edit. Information transmitted through boards,
        chats, polls or through any other means remain in Our databases and become the
        property of Dhokebaaz upon submission. Keep this in mind if You decide to
        communicate personal information through any of these applications.

        To
        preserve the integrity of Our databases, standard procedure calls for Us to
        retain information submitted by members for an indefinite length of time. Dhokebaaz
        understands Your submissions as consent to store all Your information in one
        place for this indefinite length of time, if We so wish. If required by law, as
        is the case to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
        (COPPA), We will nullify member information by erasing it from Our database. We
        will also respond to written member requests to nullify account information.
        Also, by using the Dhokebaaz Platform, You do hereby represent and warrant that
        You understand and agree that all information submitted by You through the Dhokebaaz
        Platform or otherwise to Dhokebaaz becomes the property of Dhokebaaz and may be
        used in the sole discretion of Dhokebaaz in accordance with this Privacy Policy
        and the Terms of Use.
